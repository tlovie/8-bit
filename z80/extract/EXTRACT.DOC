	EXTRACT is a program that allows a person to down load a  '.LBR' 
file  in  its  entirety and then extract any part or all of it at his 
leisure.  One of the problems I encountered was down  loading  files, 
then  missing  a critical one. I currently am running 8 floppy drives 
and four hardisks, which created the necessity of extracting files to 
different  user  numbers as well as different drives.  EXTRACT allows 
this from the command line. The format is  the  same  that  Compuview 
uses in the "VPLUS" editor.

	EXTRACT  has  a  built  in  help  function,  to  use  just enter 
"EXTRACT" and this will bring up the help menu.

	The format for the command is drive  colon,  library  file  name 
with  an  optional  extent. If a extent isn't entered, the default is 
".LBR". If the library file is under a different  user,  right  after 
the  filename  enter  "=X" where "X" is the user number. Note, do not 
enter a space after the file name. When the  library  file  names  is 
entered,  enter a space, followed by the optional drive name that the 
files will go to, followed with the file  name  and  extension.   The 
filename  and  extension  can  be  any  valid  CP/M  filename  entry, 
including wildcards. After this is entered, you can enter an optional 
"=X" which will send the output to user number "X".

	At  the  beginning  of  EXTRACT  at  location 103H is a flag for 
automatic erasure of an existing output file. If this flag  is  equal 
to  a  non  zero  value,  the file will be automatically erased if it 
exists before the file is extracted. If this flag is equal  to  zero, 
you  will  be prompted before the file is erased. If you elect not to 
erase the file, the file will not be extracted from the library.

	AT location 104H in extract is the verbose flag. If this is  set 
to zero progress messages will be displayed as EXTRACT is running.

	This  program  is  free  for  anybody  to use, but it is not for 
resale.  There is a trap in the program,  if  the  copyright  message 
doesn't  match  the hidden one, EXTRACT will destroy itself. Just for 
information purposes part of  the  message  is  executed  during  the 
extraction  of each file. There is a lot of error checking, so only a 
deliberate changing of the copyright messages will cause this trap.

 	If any  problems occur, leave  a  message  under  a  file  named 
"HELP.GIL"  and  I  will  try  to correct the problems.  Note EXTRACT 
signs on  with  a  version  number  as  well  as  date  and  time  of 
compulation.   So   when  entering  problems,  include  the  version, 
revision, date, and time.

Enjoy;
